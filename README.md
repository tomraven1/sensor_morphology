# sensor_morphology
 
Run Optimal_sensor_morphology.m with the desired paramters to get the optimized sensor morphologies.
sensor_infromation.m contains the deformation model and entropy measures
Run testing.m for visualization of the sensor morphology
Run sampling_eim.sensor for getting samples from the optimized sensor for learning
nn_Regression.m is used for learning

The folder smooth_small_circle contains some optimized sensor models and samples

The experiment folder contains the experimental data and codes

The folder persc contains simulation data for sensors of various sizes
